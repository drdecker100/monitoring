#Data Center

Terminologies
#Greenfield = new built-to-suit needs

#Brownfield = existing, repurposed

#Redundancy = duplication of equipment or systems

#Reliability = likelihood of meeting functions over time 

#Availability = amount of time system is functioning

#Uptime = time that equipment & systems are available to perform functions

#Downtime = time that equipment & systems are not

#PUE = Power Usage Effectiveness

#TGG = The Green Grid

#UTI = Uptime Institute

#PDU = Power Distribution Unit

#CRAC = Computer Room Air-Conditioning unit

#CRAH = Computer Room Air Handling unit

#IRC = In-Row Cooling Unit 

#CHWS /R = Chilled Water Supply / Return

#UPS = Uninterruptable Power Supply

#RAID =  Redundant Array of Independent Disks

#White space = The areas of the data center that houses the IT equipment

#Raised access floor  =Provides an elevated structural floor above a concrete slab to create a hidden void for the passage of mechanical and electricalservices

#Ceiling plenum = Space above a ceiling that allows power, air or other items to traverse 

#Floor plenum = Space below a raised floor that allows power air or other items to traverse

#FP = Fire protection

#PDU = Power Distribution Unit 

#RPP = Remote Power Panel

#UPS = Uninterruptable Power Supply 

#CRAC = Computer Room Air Conditioner

#NOC = Network Operations CENTER

#VESDA = VERY early smoke detection apparatus

#ICS = Industrial controls security

#PLC = Programmable logic controller

#FP = fire protection

#FA = fire alarm

#DC is a room/facility that houses computer systems 

#Networks, storage, processing

#Data Center Planning
-----------------------------------------
There are many phases and implementing a data center

1. Obtain requirements
2. Plan 
3. Design
4. Procure
5. Construct
6. Commission
7. Monitor & Manage
8. Operate & maintain

Against strategy phase = planning, analysing, designing, implementing, Maintaining

-----------------------------------------
CLASS & SIZE OVERVIEW
-----------------------------------------
DC SIZES
#Server closet
#Server room
#Small, local data center
#Mid-size, dedicated data denter
#Large, enterprise, world class DC

DC Types
#Containerized
#Modular
#Co-location
#Enterprise
+Company, organinzation

-----------------------------------------
POWER USAGE EFFECTIVENESS
-----------------------------------------
PUE = total facility energy / IT Energy

Total Facility Energy = IT Energy + Cooling Energy + Electrical losses

Cooling Energy = Chiller + Chiller Water Pump + Cooling Tower + Condenser Water Pump + CRAC Units + AHUs + Humidifiers

#Target PUE for your primary site
1-1.2 = 12% ; 1.2-1.5 = 47% ; 1.5-2.0 = 38% ; 2.0-2.5 = 2%

-----------------------------------------
MODERN DC: 3 Key Definitions
-----------------------------------------
#Reliability
Ability of a system to perform its required functions under stated conditions for a specified period of time

Five 9s (99.999%)

#Reliabilty is need from bottoem to the top to meet the goals of the end users
Facility --> communication physical infra --> Network --> Data processing & storage platforms --> Apps

#Availability is the proportion of time a system is in functioning conditions

A loss of availability doesnt end when the power comes back on. Servers also need time to recover

#Redundancy is duplication of critical components or functions of a system with the intention of increasing reliabitlity

-----------------------------------------
REDUNDANCY LEVELS
-----------------------------------------
Tier I - Basic = +Single Path , +No redundancy
Tier II - Redundant capacity = Single path , redundant components
Tier III - Concurrently maintainable = multiple paths; only one active ;redundancy, concurrently maintanable
Tier IV - multiple active paths, redundancy, concurrently maintanable 

TIA 942 DATA CENTER STANDARDS


-----------------------------------------
IT EQUIPMENT
-----------------------------------------
#IT equipment is broken down into network, storage, compute

#Is supported by mechanical, electrical and other IT equipment

#A network consists of multiple devices that communicate with one another.

#Storage = enable data and application storage within a data center facility.
Tape, disk, solid state

SERVERS 
#Traditional = independent, lower cost
#Blades = higher density, more efficient, modular components

-----------------------------------------
POWER EQUIPMENT
-----------------------------------------
EXTERIOR
#Utility transformer = Transforms voltage down for data center use

#Automatic transfer switch = switches between the main electrical supply utility and a generator power source

#Generators = provides power during an extended utiity outage

INTERIOR 
--Electrical room: UPS
#UPS = ensures continuous power to the IT equipment
#Utility power/grid power is the normal electrical source
#Batteries(or other UPS sytem) used for short-term power interruptions
#Generators used for longer-term interruptions of >90 secs


--ELectrical rooms: SWITCHGEAR 
#switchgear, substations, transformers, moto control centers  are for safety and to optimize the power path

#Larger PDUs can be located in electrical rooms before distribution to other PDUs or racks
 
#BATTERY ROOMS
Provides power during an extended utility outage

#power in white space
#Rack mounted PDUs #Floor mounted PDU # Overhead busway PDU
