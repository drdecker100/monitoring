# System testing is actually a series of different tests whose sole purpose is to exercise the full computer based system. What you verify in system testing ?

# 1. End to End Scenraio testing is testing the fully integrated applications including external peripherals(any external device that provides input and output for the system)
in order to check how components interact with one another and with the system as a whole.

# 2. Verify thorough testing of every input in the application to check for desired outputs.

# 3. testing of the user's experience with the application.

# Types of system Testing - usabiltiy testing ; - stress testing ; - regressiom testing ; - functional testing ; unit testing ; integration testing

# Unit Testing test each part of the program and shows that the individual parts are correct, 
whereas Integration Testing combines different modules in the application and test as a group to see they are working fine

# Intgration testing
in this phase of testing, individual modukes are combined and tested as a group. Data transfer between the modules is tested thoroughly.

# Incremental Testing
modules are tested as and when they are available. 

A stub (A stub may simulate the behavior of existing code or be a temporary substitute for yet-to-be-developed code) is created in palce of the awaiting module.
