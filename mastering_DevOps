DEVOPS

#Origin
Waterfall involves performing a series of sequential activities starting with requirements followed by
analysis,design, coding, testing and implementation

Andrew clay shaafer organised a sessrion called agile infrastructure transformation

Traditionally the developers and operations were handled separately

Dev = Plan, Code, Build, TEst

Release

Ops = Deploy, Operate, Monitor,  

Patrick Dubois = HR, MGMT, FIN, SALES, DEV , OPS

#Development teams want to add new features as quickly as possible

#Operations teams focused on stability and resistant to change

#Bringing Dev and Ops teams closer together means that delivering value quickly, quality and stability are shared goals

#Understanding goals and how they are align to the overall mission helps to deliver the best outcomes

#Many organizations lack this transparency

#This could result in a huge amount of wasted effort and increated operational costs

-----------------------------
THREE WAYS
#the first way - systems thinking
#the second way - amplify feedback
#third way  - culture of continuosus experimentation and learning

5 focusing steps --> Identify , Exploit, Subordinate, Elevate, Repeat

--------------------------------------
CALMS
acronym for Culture, Automation, Lean , measuring, s
Culture -- a collective sense of purpose, people first, collaboration, continuous learning and self-improving(kaizen(japanese language)
----------------
Demings PDCA
Plan - Articulate value and effort

Do- Implement actions

Check - Analyze outcomes

Act - do next?
------------------
Key Point - look beyond current horizon

---------------------------------------------------------
Automation
---------------------------------------------------------
AUTOMATING REPETITIVE TIME CONSUMING AND ERROR PRONE TASKS 

----automation strategies
repeatable manual activities are time consuming, error prone and expensive 

an automation strategy should be aligned with enterprise goals

automating existing processes as-is or copying others use cases will be sub-optimal and risky

consider all options before automating legacy services

 -------------------------------
 9 types of DEvOps Automation
 -------------------------------
1. INFRASTRUCTURE 
#Virtualization and cloud technologies enable unprecedented levels of Enterprise Agility
Traditional ways offered resistance to innovation and scaling, unlike virtualization

#Faciltates On-demand provision and auto-scaling

#Defining infrastructure as code and using platforms to specifically manage security, environments
deployment etc. maintains consistency and quality

2. TEST
# Test Automation is a fundamental aspect of DevOps

#It helps to significantly improve the reliability of your systems

#Without test automation, you are effectively building legacy

3. BUILD
#Involves compiling code, executing tests and static code analysis to enforce quality and reduce the risk of security vulnerabilities

#delivery teams are notified of build features and are fixed immediately

#Build artefacts are often uploaded to an enterprise wide repo for deployment

4. DEPLOY
#Build artefacts are automatically applied to a specified environment

#This typically involves verifying the success of the deployment, 
notifying stakeholders and rolling back to a known state if necessary

#Containers and container orchestrators(e.g. Kubernetes) are commonly being used for deployment 

5. PIPELINE
#Refers to automating the sequential exectution of the various steps leading up to and including deployment

#Orchestrating these tasks is commonly called the DevOps Pipeline"

#Key to building consistency and confidence in the delivery processes

6. MONITORING
#Every layer of the architecture needs to be monitored for unexpected behaviour

#Any issues need to be raised and workflow in place to route them to the appropriate teams

#Monitoring solutions becoming increasing sophisticated with auto-remediation and self-healing

7. METRICS
#Systems need to be capable of measuring pre-defined Key Performance indicators(KPIs)

#BaSELINing outcome based  KPIs as well as measures relating to the DevOps practices being followed is essential for continuous
improvement

8. SERVICE
#Once an incident has been raised, ahole new set of workflows takes place.

#Automating certain activities in the workflow, such as escalations and change documentaton,
can speed up resolution time significantly and reduce business impact.

9. COMMUNICATION
#it is important to ensure delivery data and outcome metrics are visible via communication channels that support timely action.

#these channels must expose information transparently to all stakeholders

#Helps to avoid inaccurate interpretation and reporting --"The Watermelon Effect"
