I’ve been refining my networking skills with side projects, and schooling . 
I’m looking for an opportunity where I can put those abilities to work for a mission I’m passionate about. 
I was also excited to read in the job description that this role will require regular application of the skills learnt 
—one of my key motivators is the ability to connect with colleagues and communicate my team’s work, so this is an especially exciting part of this opportunity.
Ultimately, I’ve learned a lot from my past work experiences, 
and I’m looking for the next step where I can continue to grow and use the skills I’ve honed at a company I love, and this opportunity seems to be a great fit.


In my recent internship program, I was tasked to build a service that will automate the processes of the company. 
I worked with the other team members to create and troubleshoot the new microservice. 
I was able to finish the development days ahead of schedule.


I have worked hard in previous jobs to develop specific and necessary soft and hard skills for this position. 
I am a highly organized person, which makes me a great choice for this position. 
I am a team player, working with other team mates to achieve a goal and very adaptable.


I have a strong set of skills that uniquely qualify me for this job. 
I'm well-versed in a wide range of computer programming languages. 
I recently completed professional development on the latest updates to Python. 
I'm considered an expert source controller, and I lead a training for my colleagues in my last position on best practices for source control. 
I'm also good at writing tests for my code, so the company won't have to hire an outside tester which will save time and money.
