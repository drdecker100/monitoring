#critical KPIs(key Performance indicators) 
1. CapEx  #Capital expenditures (CapEx) are funds used by a company to acquire, upgrade, and maintain physical assets such as property, plants, buildings, technology, or equipment. CapEx is often used to undertake new projects or investments by a company.
2. OpEx   #An operating expense, operating expenditure, operational expense, operational expenditure or opex is an ongoing cost for running a product, business, or system.3. 
3. TTM    #time to market is the length of time it takes from a product being conceived until its being available for sale. The reason that time to market is so important is because being late erodes the addressable market that you have to sell your product into.
4. Uptime #Uptime is a measure of system reliability, expressed as the percentage of time a machine
